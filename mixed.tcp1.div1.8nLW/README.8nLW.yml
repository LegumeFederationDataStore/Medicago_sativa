description: Variants (SNPs and indels) called on 27 Medicago sativa accessions, called with respect to a consensus assembly based on those accessions. The accessions included "27 alfalfa genotypes, including elite breeding genotypes, parents of mapping populations, and unimproved wild genotypes (Li, Acharya et al., 2012; DOI: 10.1186/1471-2164-13-568)
