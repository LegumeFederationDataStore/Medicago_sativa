  medsa.mixed.tcp1.div1.8nLW.txt.gz: Variant calls from mapping of Illumina reads from 27 alfalfa lines to the contigs from lista_medsa-201204. Variant filtering criteria required at least two reads from a
  single: sample calling the variant allele with an average quality of at least 20, and the frequency of bases calling the variant in that sample at that position being at least 20.
  medsa.mixed.tcp1.div1.8nLW.ADT_scored_Mt_mapped.txt.gz: Contains the subset of variants called above that could be scored under the Illumina GoldenGate Assay Design Tool, along with their flanking sequence, ADT designability scores, and mapping information to the Medicago truncatula genome (Mt3.5.1) based on gmap alignment of the contigs.
